Open data for Scottish Official Statistics is available at https://statistics.gov.scot. Managed by the Scottish Goverment, this data store contains (mostly) official statistics covering a wide range of topics, and from a range of official statistics producers.

Data can be read directly into R using an API, rather than downloaded and loaded locally. This folder contains example code showing how to do this.
